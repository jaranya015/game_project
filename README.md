    Code Overview
The code is divided into three main files:

1. 'main.py': This file contains the main application and the MainWidget class, which is responsible for rendering the game graphics and handling user input.
2. 'user_actions.py': This file contains functions for handling user input, such as keyboard and touch events.
3. 'transforms.py': This file contains functions for transforming the game graphics based on the perspective point.

The game uses Kivy's canvas to render the graphics and the Kivy clock for updating the game state.
